### Introduction
This project presents a smart trolley system designed to streamline the shopping experience by leveraging IoT technology. 
Traditional checkout processes can be time-consuming and cumbersome, especially during peak hours. 
Our solution aims to revolutionize the shopping experience by integrating product identification, price display, and automated payment directly within the shopping trolley. 
By utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller and various hardware components, this system offers a user-friendly interface, real-time product information display, and a secure exit mechanism.

### Features
Barcode scanning and product identification using an ESP32 microcontroller and camera module.
Weight-based product monitoring for accurate inventory management.
User interaction through a touch panel interface for adding/removing items and initiating payment.
Real-time display of scanned items, quantities, prices, and total cost on an LCD screen.
Secure exit mechanism controlled by a servo motor, ensuring the door unlocks only after successful payment verification.
Integration with cloud-based database and payment systems for scalability, security, and data management.
Modular design for easy development, maintenance, and potential future upgrades.
